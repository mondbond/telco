TELCO

Main goal of the project is to get familiar with production-like tools like Kedro and MLflow, tracking different parameters of the model.

For example, I took the Telco dataset from Kaggle in order to resolve a binary classification problem with Keras and show the metrics.

*This is newly created evidence of my experience with Kedro, MLflow, and Keras.
*A few months ago, I worked on a more complex experimental project using these tools,
*although I did not preserve that work at the time, as it was not intended as a long-term project.
