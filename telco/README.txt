TELCO

Main goal of the projects is get familiar with production-like tools like kedro and mlflow, tracking different parameters of the model.

For example I took the telco dataset from kaggle in order to resolve binary classification with keras problem and show the metrics.

*This is newly created evidence of my experience with kedro, MLflow, and keras.
*A few months ago, I worked on a more complex experimental project using these tools,
*although I did not preserve that work at the time, as it was not intended for long-term project.
